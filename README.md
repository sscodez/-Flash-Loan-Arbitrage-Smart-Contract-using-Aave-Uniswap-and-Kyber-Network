# Flash-Loan-Arbitrage-Smart-Contract-using-Aave-Uniswap-and-Kyber-Network
This contract uses Aave flash loans &amp; Uniswap/Kyber exchanges for arbitrage trading. Users borrow DAI &amp; buy ETH on the cheaper exchange for profit, then repay the flash loan + fee &amp; keep the profit. No collateral is required, showcasing the power of flash loans for accessing liquidity.


Importing necessary libraries and interfaces:
The first lines of the contract imports the required libraries and interfaces for using the Aave flash loan functionality, as well as the Uniswap and Kyber network interfaces for the arbitrage trades.

Defining the contract:
The main contract is defined as FlashLoanArbitrage, which is set up to inherit from the FlashLoanReceiverBase contract provided by Aave.

Defining variables:
The contract defines several variables, including addresses for the lending pool, token addresses for DAI, ETH, and other tokens, as well as instances of the Uniswap and Kyber network interfaces.

Defining the executeArbitrage function:
This function is where the arbitrage trades take place. The function first takes out a flash loan for a specified amount of DAI. The DAI is then used to purchase ETH on either the Uniswap or Kyber network, depending on which offers a better price. The purchased ETH is then immediately sold on the other network for a profit. The profits are used to repay the flash loan plus a small fee, and the remaining profits are transferred to the contract owner.

Defining the startArbitrage function:
This function simply calls the executeArbitrage function and passes in the amount of DAI to be borrowed as an argument.

Defining the receiveFlashLoan function:
This function is required by the FlashLoanReceiverBase contract and is called by the Aave protocol when the flash loan is executed. In this function, the arbitrage trade is initiated by calling the executeArbitrage function.
